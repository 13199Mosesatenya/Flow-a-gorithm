# Flow-a-gorithm-
raphSleuth is an algorithm-centric framework for detecting anomalies in network traffic through graph-based modeling and subgraph analysis. This project combines subgraph isomorphism, incremental detection algorithms, and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to identify suspicious patterns in dynamic network flow data.
